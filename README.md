## Activities
Hi! I am Kayla. I am new in programming. I choose python as my first programming language to master because I am interested in building rest-api frameworks using it and I love the modules that you can use in python.

- script.py
Problem: You are a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. You want to provide your students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

- shipping.py
Problem: Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal’s Shippers. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages. In this project, you’ll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.
