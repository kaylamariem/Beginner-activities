## Activities
Hi! I am Kayla. I am new in programming. I choose python as my first programming language to master because I am interested in building rest-api frameworks, and creating automation tools using it for future projects and I love the modules that you can use in python. But for now I will start my programming journey from the basics.

- script.py
Problem: You are a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. You want to provide your students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

- shipping.py
Problem: Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal’s Shippers. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages. In this project, you’ll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers. (conversion is given from the codeacademy site)

- threadshed_script.py
Problem: You’ve recently been hired as a cashier at the local sewing hobby shop, Thread Shed. Some of your daily responsibilities involve tallying the number of sales during the day, calculating the total amount of money made, and keeping track of the names of the customers. Unfortunately, the Thread Shed has an extremely out-dating register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales. All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. Your task is to use your Python skills to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier to access lists.
